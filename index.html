            <p>The Mill is a multi-arts, not for profit organisation where artists of all disciplines come to elevate and amplify their practice.
        </br></br>
        Our organisation is rich with stories. We witness and celebrate every part of the artistic process, facilitating insight and multiple levels of criticality. It’s a place to feel connected, inspired and motivated to create great work.
        </br></br>
        The Mill is recognised as a hub of creative innovation and cross-artform practice, making great contributions to the national contemporary arts sector, and positively impacting South Australia’s cultural landscape.
        </br></br>
        Our rich, year-round program provides artists with the necessary physical space to work on their practice, alongside diverse public events, performances and exhibitions, and professional development opportunities.
        </br></br>
        The Mill’s masterclasses, workshops and residencies place local artists, both emerging and established, with leading practitioners from across the country, and around the world.
        </br></br>
        Since 2013, The Mill has provided artists with short and long-term support, always advocating for artistic careers and responding to the aspirations of our community. </p></br></br>

        <h1> About the program </h1></br>

        <p>The Bait Fridge are our incoming Artists in Residence in The Mill's Exhibition Space in 2020. Due to the current COVID-19 crisis, this residency is developing new ways of creating digital content so that the residency can be available online. The Bait Fridge collective will be in residence from March 17 to May 29. With a focus on artistic process, this two-month residency allows audiences direct access to creative research and making. This residency is presented in partnership with City of Adelaide.</p></br>

        <p>The Bait Fridge is a multi-disciplinary collective from South Australia whose members collaborate under a unified banner to create works and performances which combine the practices of music, art, dance, costume and theatre. Through this project The Bait Fridge will be developing ideas, costumes, performances, sculpture and music. Working with materials that other people might consider to be trash allows the collective to see beyond traditional boundaries of artists practice. Each of the members of the collective brings their own unique energy, while working collaboratively, with each other as well as audiences, allowing The Bait Fridge to explore new ways of creating and bringing new understandings to concepts of ‘art’ and the role of the ‘artist’.</p></br>

        <p>The Mill invites you to witness The Bait Fridge’s creative practice digitally and gain insight into their collaborative process as the residency unfolds across a 10 week period.</p></br>

        <p>Although we are currently practicing social distancing, in light of COVID-19, we will be presenting digital content for you to enjoy from the comfort of your homes. Please keep an eye on our social media for updates.</p></br>

        <p> Presented in partnership with the City of Adelaide. </p>

            It began in the Clare Valley in 2015 at Blenheim Music & Camping Festival. A simple 5 person spontaneous explosion of art and music: A few people throwing paint around and improvising on their instruments. Now there are more than 20 of us, all refined in our own practices and free to explore and collaborate as a collective. We create handmade costumes; interactive art installations; improvised and written musical performances; audience participatory workshops; photography; and all of these combined.

            While it all started at Blenheim Festival, we’ve since extended our practice to a range of spaces throughout South Australia. This includes, but is not limited to, running workshops at the Art Gallery of SA; curating SALA’s Finissage Events; performing at the Fringe Club and Field Good Festival; exhibiting at SMOCK gallery; and now, a residency at The Mill.

            We hope to use the time of our residency to develop new works and methods of collaboration, while also looking back at what we’ve done in the past. And while the timing of COVID-19 ​has disrupted our initial plans,​ The Bait Fridge are an adaptive group and recognise it as an opportunity to work in an unprecedented way. Zoom zoom.

<div id="max"><p>The Bait Fridge is a multi-disciplinary collective from South Australia whose members include Felix Rossbach, Zeno Kordov, Dave Court, Declan Casley-Smith, Greta Wyatt, Adrian Schmidt Mumm, Annabel Scheid, Henry Jock Walker, Liam Sommerville, Tom Hannagan, Arlon Hall, Hari Koutlakis, Mat Morison, Emmaline Zanelli, Kaspar Schmidt Mumm and Daria Koljanin.

It began in 2014 at Blenheim Music and Camping Festival in Clare Valley as a spontaneous performance of expressive art and experimental music. The Bait Fridge has consistently performed at Blenheim Festival every year since growing from a 5-piece outfit in its inception to over 15 participants in 2018, finding its way into elaborate costume construction, audience participatory art making and The Bait Fridge Band. Recent works have involved improvised narrative performance with accompanying music, sculptural instruments, professional dancers, audience involvement, workshops and elaborate stage construction. The Bait Fridge have performed and activated spaces consistently from their conception including SALA’s Finissage events, Activate Ramsay’s Place (Colonnades Shopping Centre), SMOCK and AGSA Neo Teens workshop.</p></div>

<div id="chillin"><h1>‘Collective practice is the mitochondria of the BFcell. All of our individual practices have been challenged and mulched by the collective environment of the Bait Fridge. It has taught all Baities at different times how to let go of sole authority over their own work (independence is an illusion! No person is an island!), and that can be an incredibly liberating experience but also something uncomfortable! The Bait Fridge is a constant exercise in creative compromise and resourcefulness, and everyone in the crew has gone on to draw from the group in different ways in their personal projects, whether it is by reaching out for people to perform in their work or get involved in some way, or even just to have a tight community to use as a springboard when we need support.’ — Emmaline Zanelli</h1></div>
