            Hello. Welcome. We are The Bait Fridge
            A collective of South Australian artists from various disciplines. We work together to create works and performances which combine our practices under one banner. We make art, music, dance, theatre, photography, and more.
        </br></br>
            It began in the Clare Valley in 2015 at Blenheim Music & Camping Festival. A simple 5 person spontaneous explosion of art and music: A few people throwing paint around and improvising on their instruments. Now there are more than 20 of us, all refined in our own practices and free to explore and collaborate as a collective. We create handmade costumes; interactive art installations; improvised and written musical performances; audience participatory workshops; photography; and all of these combined.
        </br></br>
            While it all started at Blenheim Festival, we’ve since extended our practice to a range of spaces throughout South Australia. This includes, but is not limited to, running workshops at the Art Gallery of SA; curating SALA’s Finissage Events; performing at the Fringe Club and Field Good Festival; exhibiting at SMOCK gallery; and now, a residency at The Mill.
        </br></br>
            We hope to use the time of our residency to develop new works and methods of collaboration, while also looking back at what we’ve done in the past. And while the timing of COVID-19 ​has disrupted our initial plans,​ The Bait Fridge are an adaptive group and recognise it as an opportunity to work in an unprecedented way. Zoom zoom.

<div id="max"><p>The Bait Fridge is a multi-disciplinary collective from South Australia whose members include Felix Rossbach, Zeno Kordov, Dave Court, Declan Casley-Smith, Greta Wyatt, Adrian Schmidt Mumm, Annabel Scheid, Henry Jock Walker, Liam Sommerville, Tom Hannagan, Arlon Hall, Hari Koutlakis, Mat Morison, Emmaline Zanelli, Kaspar Schmidt Mumm and Daria Koljanin. They collaborate to create works and performances which combine the practices of music, art, dance, costume and theatre. It began in 2014 at Blenheim Music and Camping Festival in Clare Valley as a spontaneous performance of expressive art and experimental music. The Bait Fridge has consistently performed at Blenheim Festival every year since growing from a 5-piece outfit in its inception to over 15 participants in 2018, finding its way into elaborate costume construction, audience participatory art making and The Bait Fridge Band. Recent works have involved improvised narrative performance with accompanying music, sculptural instruments, professional dancers, audience involvement, workshops and elaborate stage construction. The Bait Fridge have performed and activated spaces consistently from their conception including SALA’s Finissage events, Activate Ramsay’s Place (Colonnades Shopping Centre), SMOCK and AGSA Neo Teens workshop.</p></div>

<div id="chillin"><h1>‘Collective practice is the mitochondria of the BFcell. All of our individual practices have been challenged and mulched by the collective environment of the Bait Fridge. It has taught all Baities at different times how to let go of sole authority over their own work (independence is an illusion! No person is an island!), and that can be an incredibly liberating experience but also something uncomfortable! The Bait Fridge is a constant exercise in creative compromise and resourcefulness, and everyone in the crew has gone on to draw from the group in different ways in their personal projects, whether it is by reaching out for people to perform in their work or get involved in some way, or even just to have a tight community to use as a springboard when we need support.’ — Emmaline Zanelli</h1></div>
